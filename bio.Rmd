title: "Short Bio"
---
I was born in Wenzhou, China and lived in Shanghai for 15 years before I came to America. I earned my bachelor's degree in statistics at School of Management, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. I'm a big fan of GNU softwares. I don't  use Windows often, except for playing games and watching videos. I'm single-minded, so I do not use IDEs to write codes. Here is my [CV](file/resume_re.pdf).
